FIXME: "BaseTransaction 2 does not exist" error message despite
BaseTransaction.objects.get(pk=2) does not fail.
Some .transaction query fails.

FIXME: It seems that canceling old_subscription does not work!

Need to implement PayPal Checkout.
At first it may seem that for PayPal Checkout we do not need to store the payment info
in the DB until the payment is accomplished. But in reality we need, because prices
and currencies may change in the middle.

For PayPal Checkout, we should split BaseTransaction into billing plan and billing
agreement models.

Don't wait for IPN to terminate subscription.
